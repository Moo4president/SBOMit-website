# Content translation

Generate `es` / `fr` / `zh` / `vi` Hugo content from English sources via DeepL.

## Setup

1. DeepL API key in `.env` (gitignored):

   ```
   DeepL_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

   (`DEEPL_API_KEY` also works.) Free-tier keys end in `:fx`.

2. Install deps: `npm install`

## Usage

```bash
npm run translate
```

Translates:

- `content/_index.md`
- `content/faq.md`
- `content/community.md`
- `content/documentation.md`

Skips `CHARTER.md`. Writes `content/*.{es,fr,zh,vi}.md`. Adds `translationKey` to English sources when missing.

## Protected technical terms

Before DeepL runs, each block goes through:

1. **URL mask** — markdown link targets (`](https://…)`) and bare `https://` URLs become numbered placeholders (`⟦0⟧`); DeepL never sees the URL.
2. **Term protection** — terms such as **SBOM**, **in-toto**, **attestation**, **layout**, **SLSA**, and **FRSCA** are wrapped in `<x>…</x>` (`ignore_tags: x`) so they stay in English.
3. After translation, placeholders and `<x>` tags are restored in reverse order.

Edit `PROTECTED_TERMS` in `scripts/translate.mjs` to add more protected terms.

## Cache

Translations are cached by SHA-256 of each English **block** (blank-line segments; fenced code never translated) in `scripts/.translate-cache.json`. The cache version prefix in `translate.mjs` is bumped when translation logic changes, which forces a one-time re-translate of all blocks.

- Edit one English paragraph → only that block is re-billed.
- Second run with no English changes → zero API calls.
- Commit the cache with the generated `.md` files so clones stay cheap.

## Hand-fixing a translation

Edit the locale file directly (e.g. `content/faq.es.md`). The cache keys off the **English** source hash, so your edit survives until that English block changes. After the English block changes, DeepL overwrites the locale block on the next `npm run translate`.

## Reset cache

```bash
rm scripts/.translate-cache.json
npm run translate
```
